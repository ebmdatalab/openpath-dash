  <p>
    This page provides of a summary of our Data Protection Impact
    Assessment (DPIA), which has been signed off with our division's
    Information Compliance team.
  </p>

<h2>How will we obtain data?</h2>

  <p>Data will be collected from NHS pathology laboratories based
  in NHS Hospital Trusts.</p>
  <p>This data is stored by each Trust in their own LIMS (pathology
  database), which are typically in different formats. &nbsp;When a
  pathology request comes in from primary or secondary care, the
  request is stored in the LIMS. Every LIMS is different. In each
  case, we will ask for a monthly extract which covers the
  requestor, their location, the test(s) requested, an internal
  identifier for the sample, an internal (hospital) identifier for
  the patient, sex, and age.</p>

  <p>We will contact each Trust separately and follow their Data
  Sharing procedures to agree an extract of this database.
  &nbsp;When an agreement is signed, a LIMS operator will carry out
  a database extract and provide the data to us in CSV or Excel
  format.</p>
  <p>Data will be transferred from Trusts via the<a href=
  "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/divisional-services/support-services-1/data-privacy/medical-sciences-office/document-storage-and-sharing/storage-options/filr&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1567690663803000">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/divisional-services/support-services-1/data-privacy/medical-sciences-office/document-storage-and-sharing/storage-options/filr&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1567690663803000">Filr
  service</a>&nbsp;provided by the University’s Medical Sciences
  Division (MSD) IT service, and then transferred to the virtual
  server over SSH. These services are provided by MSD IT, and meet
  the University’s baseline standard.</p>
  <h2 id="h.lkahftgs3f7">How will we store and process the
  data?</h2>
  <p>The data will be stored and initially processed on a network
  drive accessed via a secure<a href=
  "https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/support-services/teams/information-technology/servers-and-data-services/msd-it-virtual-servers&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1567690663804000">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/support-services/teams/information-technology/servers-and-data-services/msd-it-virtual-servers&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1567690663804000">virtual
  hosted server</a>, accessible to 3 named individuals in our team.
  The server will be provided and managed by the University’s
  Medical Sciences Division (MSD) IT service.</p>

  <p>The individuals permitted access will process the data to
  further anonymise and aggregate it into two formats, within the
  secure area (marked Secured MSD IT Services in Appendix A).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The first format will be entirely anonymised, suitable for
    publication in full as data.</li>
    <li>The second format will be pseudonymised (prior to us
    receiving the data) and aggregated&nbsp;with low-number
    suppression for incorporation into research publications; this
    will contain high-level identifiable data in the form of sex
    and age band, grouped by these and aggregated by test results,
    and with low numbers (N &lt; 5) suppressed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Prior to publication, anonymisation of both formats will be
  categorised by the SIRO as per the Departmental Anonymisation
  policy. Examples are given in Appendix B.</p>

  <p>The fully anonymised&nbsp;data will leave the secure area over
  SSH and will be processed on third-party servers to perform
  further statistical analyses and visualisations to help audit and
  inform pathology activities by requesting clinicians. This data
  will be freely available to the public, with the agreement of
  each Trust, and as such no longer subject to strict security
  controls.</p>

  <p>Anonymised extracts of the aggregated, pseudonymised
  data&nbsp;will be published in data tables in individual research
  papers.</p>
  <h2 id="h.ryu8wik71ivk">Purpose of data processing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide GPs simple, actionable feedback on their request
    rates and results data, allowing them to e.g. identify outliers
    for targeted improvement, and investigate those responding
    quickly or slowly to changes in cost and evidence. This will
    improve patient outcomes by helping address under- and
    over-testing rates</li>
    <li>By creating a tool which could be rolled out nationally we
    save local NHS teams time, effort and money in building these
    tools themselves.</li>
    <li>To document variation in care in relation to pathology
    testing, more widely than our recent similar studies.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our lawful basis is GDPR articles 6.1.e public interest and
  9.2.j research. &nbsp;See Stage 2 part 4, above (cost saving for
  NHS, improving patient outcomes)</p>
  <h2 id="h.9k34xoi88n2g">Transparency</h2>
  <p>We will add a page on our website for individuals whose data
  may be included, providing the following transparency
  information:</p>
  <ol start="1">
    <li>The purposes for which their data will be processed?</li>
    <li>The people or organisations their data will be shared
    with?</li>
    <li>The lawful basis for processing their data?</li>
    <li>Any international transfers of their personal data</li>
    <li>When their personal data will be erased?</li>
    <li>Their rights under GDPR?</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="h.jx9nr14pxzie">Data retention</h2>
  <p>Data will be kept for 5 years, in order to provide time trends
  analyses.</p>
  <h2 id="h.rdk1dvnqzgoc">Ethics</h2>
  <p>There is no need for ethics approval for the project at
  present, as this was classed by the Ethics Team as a “service
  development” project. We will seek appropriate ethical approvals
  for research projects as required.</p>

  <p>Where a Lab provides an internal patient identifier, this will
  be either a randomised key or a hospital unit number. We will
  never accept data including an NHS number. Hospital patient
  identifiers are always internal to the Trust and the ability to
  match these to patients will not be held by this project.</p>
  <p>Example extract of anonymised dataset for full
  publication:</p>
  <p>Note we would like to avoid low number suppression in this
  dataset as it will make working with the data much easier and
  allow better visualisations of the data. In terms of a
  deidentification attack, we have not been able to think of a way
  a person could be identified from a test and GP practice, even in
  combination with other sources. An open data NHS dataset we work
  with routinely contains data at a similar level (GP practice and
  drug) and does not have low number suppression, so we are
  familiar with thinking about these risks.</p>
