            <p>Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) is a test commonly
            performed in primary care. It is used often to diagnose
            an under or overactive thyroid. It is also used as a
            test in Tired All The Time (TATT). The 2013 Atlas of
            Variation found a 57-fold variation between GP
            practices in the level of testing. They can have a very
            low proportion of abnormal results and could be safely
            reduced (Werhun and Hamilton 2015). It may be useful
            for practices to know if they are testing at a higher
            or lower rate than average</p><a href=
